            <p>In addition to the Trump administration's ongoing <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5308628/trump-white-house-press-access-voa" target="_blank"><u>attacks</u></a> on journalists and media outlets and companies in 2025, America has been managing an evisceration of local news and a dearth of access to verified and fact-based information networks for well over a decade (Folkenflik, 2025). The increased loss of local newspapers, especially in rural communities, and the rise of alternative media, has led to more "media deserts" across the nation that are ravaging poor and rural communities (Abernathy, 2018). Abernathy (2018) disclosed that a fifth of all newspapers have gone out of business over the past 15 years, and roughly 1,800 local newspapers have been dissolved or eliminated (p. 8), leaving many cities and towns with little to no access to credible, local news. Almost 200 counties in the US have no access to a local newspaper of any kind, and about 1500 counties in the US have only one local print newspaper (Abernathy, p. 12). This shortage in local news occurs when large media companies buy smaller media companies and eliminate or drastically reduce local news coverage. Without competent and educated journalists to cover local news, and media outlets to publish and deliver it, people have limited opportunities to access credible information. Furthermore, most Americans are now accessing local news online instead of in print publications. NPR reported that since 2005, the US has gone from 7,419 non-daily papers and 1,472 daily papers to 4,792 non-dailies and 1,213 dailies <a href="https://www.stlpr.org/2024-04-15/rural-newspaper-decline-new-models-journalism" target="_blank"><u>(Meadows)</u></a>. The Pew Research Center also found that people primarily access local news on social media and websites instead of print publications <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/05/07/sources-of-local-news/" target="_blank">(<u>Pew Research Center</u>)</a>. Without a place or space to get local news that is trustworthy, people will seek out information online and potentially find themselves inside echo chambers and disinformation networks. When users find themselves in a media desert, everything online looks like water instead of a mirage. The SPN now has an affiliate in every state to help fill in local news gaps with disinformation. </p>
            <p>The amount of disinformation circulating on Facebook leading up to the election was unprecedented. In the three months leading up to the 2016 US presidential election, fake stories about the election and its candidates on Facebook were more popular, and more widely shared, than similar stories from “the New York Times, Washington Post, Huffington Post, [and] NBC News” (Silverman, 2016). Silverman reported that some of the most widely spread disinformation on “hoax sites and hyperpartisan blogs generated 8,711,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook.” 5% of all Tweets during the 2016 election cycle contained a link to an outside political source that was either fake or contained disinformation (Grinberg et al., 2019). In the 2024 election, Elon Musk leveraged his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter, to promote and circulate unprecedented amounts of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-trump-social-media-election-2024/" target="_blank"><u>disinformation</u></a> (Ingram and May). <em>Ending the Fed</em>, a website responsible for designing and disseminating disinformation, published four fabricated stories about the 2016 election that garnered almost three million engagements on Facebook in 90 days (Silverman, 2016). In 2024, Elon Musk had over 60 million followers reading and sharing his social media posts; moreover, Musk has been designated the largest <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-twitter-misinformation-timeline-1235076786/" target="_blank"><u>spreader</u></a> of disinformation in the world (Klee). This amount of interaction and engagement with disinformation on social media and disinplatforms overwhelmingly surpasses the amount of engagement users had with the top election stories in the mainstream media (MSM) or with more credible media during the same 90-day period. A significant portion of disinformation on social media like Facebook comes from junk websites and faux news outlets similar to the <a href="thespn.html"><u>State Policy Network's</u></a> disinplatforms. </p>
            <p>Disinformation on SPN websites brings people together who share a deep belief in conspiracy theories, straw men, and fictious problems only conservatives can solve. All conservative groups have historically bonded over their vehement hatred of immigrants (both legal and illegal), LGTBQ+, and BIPOC and their unwillingness to believe in science research, global warming, air-borne diseases, and vaccines. Kazin (2017) explains that “The end of the Cold War exposed how much rightists had been bound together by what they hated instead of what they wanted to change” or what they could build for each other (p. 270). Disinformation on SPN websites tries to validate the audiences' frustration with a specific ideals, policies, and people they've been told are unpatriotic, dangerous, and threatening their livelihoods. Networked disinformation always blames something or someone else for the disgruntled group's social and financial distress. For example, in the 1970's the racist and populist George Wallace employed the same types of cover words Trump uses today. Wallace threw out phrases like “law and order” and “neighborhood school” to rile up the crowds, much like Trump does today (Kazin, p. 233). Wallace's “rhetorical success stemmed from" how "he sarcastically skewered the foes of his kind of people,” driving an unnecessary wedge between Americans (Kazin, p. 234). Wallace's “performance before crowds was designed not to inspire but to incite” his base into frustration and violence (Kazin, p. 234). Wallace, like Trump, publicly hates the same people and ideals his base hates. Martin (2020) argues that cover words like law and order or "America First" obfuscate "the current administration's unethical objectives, motives, and actions for making America First and instead generates third spaces for the general public to define and validate, however it sees fit, the actions needed to make America First" (p. 143). In other words, cover words are semantic quicksand that promote disinformation because they can mean anything. </p>
            <p>The sustained weight of misleading information on millions of people over long periods of time drastically impedes their ability to make informed decisions in a timely manner. Networked disinformation across numerous digital writing environments can faciliate deep distrust that makes it hard for anyone to believe anything. When there is nowhere for people to access healthy news, they will wade through complicated disinformation they encounter online or they will lose trust in all information they encounter. Wasting time verifying information inhibits a culture of public critique from taking root, and it is, perhaps, the most devasting ramification of a disinformation for-profit media culture. Once disinformation seeps into a media culture, it spreads quickly and it is difficult to extinguish. A lack of access to healthy information systems is partially responsible for the rise of disinplatforms that have been designed to fill that void. Nonprofit think-tanks designing and circulating pseudo-research and news are highly unethical and dangerous but extremely common in the digital disinformation era. Moreover, Yochai Benkler (2019) insists that “Nonstop coverage of propaganda efforts and speculation about their impact, without actual evidence to support that impact, feeds the loss of trust in our institutions to a greater extent than the facts warrant.” Speculating whether or not disinformation is ruining democracy is possibly more perilous than the disinformation itself because the amplification of speculation without evidence erodes public trust. Democracy dies when its news and media systems are incapable of providing the general public with consistent, factual information they can trust and use to make timely decisions. </p>
            <p>To avoid becoming entangled in a network of disinplatforms, educational institutions need to redefine and recultivate a new type of intellectual craftsperson (Mills, 1959) for digital culture who can use digital and multiliteracies to investigate digital writing and media platforms. The intellectual craftsperson is a term Charles Mills used to describe the habits of mind reflective thinkers adopt to examine, interpret, engage, and analyze their world. A digital intellectual craftsperson in 2025 is skeptical of their own thinking and relies on an affective semiotics of multimodality to learn, think, and design their way through a digital world. Disinplatforms have created an opportunity for scholars who study digital writing environments to demonstrate how to use digital and technical literacies to outline a set of ethical behaviors and epistemologies for online writing and to articulate how important critical frames are for analyzing and evaluating digital writing environments. Determining what is factual and honest in digital writing environments requires a digital craftsperson with a critical mindest. Interpreting how digital writing environments and disinplatforms are networked is high order crap detection necessary to critique digital media culture. To be successful at analyzing digital writing environments in the era of accelerated neofascism and the shifting of the nation toward autocracy, citizens who favor democracy must “investigate subject positioning, stereotyping, the interaction of word and image, and the nature of human perception” in online spaces to save what is left of democracy (O'Gorman, p. 64). </p>
