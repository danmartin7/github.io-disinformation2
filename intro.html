          <p>The United States is currently living in an unprecedented age of digital disinformation and everyone desperately needs more methods to read, listen, watch, and interpret media content in digital writing environments. One significant finding in my research on digital disinformation is that politically active organizations are using nonprofit 503(c) status to form pseudo media companies in each state with the intent to design and circulate misleading content across dozens of websites, structuring and forming a massive disinformation network. These organizations use the affordances of digital writing environments to publish click-bait headlines, distracting images and graphs, fraudulent primary research, anonymous and fake sourcing, and populist rhetoric (Holiday, 2012, p. 63-64). These tactics generate layers of disinformation that are extraordinarily difficult to unravel. Using one disinformation tactic alone, one layer, may have a limited effect on an audience but layers of disinformation can strengthen an illusion of truth that is difficult to undermine. Anderson and Sayers (2015) posit that "Layers afford precisely that opportunity for unpacking the ambiguous (dis)continuities, versions, and relational pressure points" (p. 82) that make disinformation difficult to see, hear, or recognize when first encountering it. Layering disinformation puts audiences in "multiphrenetic" states where they can remain confused and disoriented for long periods of time, if not indefinitely (Gergen, 1991, p. 16). Disinformation saturation erodes self-confidence and self-identity, forcing people to constantly second guess themselves. There has been significant research on analyzing misleading content in digital writing environments (Charney, 2001; Karpf, 2019; Jenkins, 2008; Jowett & O'Donell, 2019; Lazer, et al., 2018; Martin, 2020; Marwick & Lewis, 2017), but there has been less attention paid to analyzing disinformation networks and providing specific examples of disinformation across a wide range of genres, modes, and mediums. </p>
  <p>This webtext examines how the <a href="thespn.html"><u>State Policy Network</u></a> (SPN) uses digital writing environments to manufacture a massive network of disinformation across the US. In this webtext, I outline how to recognize and interrogate networked platforms that publish and circulate disinformation. I also outline several critical literacies (Craig, 2017; Miller & Leon, 2017; Selber, 2004; Selfe, 1998; Ong, 2002; Sindoni & Moschini, 2022) I use to frame the analysis of digital writing environments, platforms, and networks. The SPN is an alt-right think tank, primarily financed by the Koch brothers, that designs and spreads disinformation across a network of websites in all 50 states. According to <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Portal:State_Policy_Network" target="_blank"><u>Sourcewatch.org</u></a>, there are over 160 members in the SPN working under a 503(c)(3) nonprofit status. For this webtext, I analyzed how <a href="spnwebsites.html"><u>64 SPN affiliates</u></a> design and spread misleading information on websites. I used McNely and Teston's (2015) approach to "field work" as a methodology to mark and code disinformation tactics I found on the websites. After collecting hundreds of pages of notes and hundreds of screenshots of web content for analysis (McNely & Teston's, 2015, p. 117), I coded and analyzed the most commonly used disinformation tactics I found on the SPN websites. I also kept track of the time and labor required to vett sources and determine the presence of disinformation on the websites. I wanted to know how much time it was taking to identify and disentangle each disinformation tactic. Increasing the labor and time needed to verify sources is the main aim of the disinformation tactics I uncovered. It is also important to emphasize that disinformation networks erratically delete, move, or replace content without notice. The SPN has relocated or deleted hundreds of webpages since I started this project in 2020. Even though I have checked all the links and references for SPN content, any of these materials can disappear at any given moment. </p>
  <p>Below is a list of the most common and reoccurring disinformation tactics I found across the 64 websites I examined over three years. These tactics require a range of digital literacies to recognize and disentangle. Explore these tactics in any order; many of them overlap and are connected:

                    <p>drastically slows down a user's ability to validate source material quickly. Every disinformation tactic on a SPN website is designed to impair the audience and make it more cumbersome to verify content. Obfuscating where sources come from and how they're made makes it too time consuming for audiences to vet information.

  <br>
  <p>The primary finding from this study is that SPN affiliates use websites to disguise disinformation in professional and academic genres. Slowing down the ability to locate and verify sources is a primary aim of the SPN's disinformation network. Asking audiences to spend excessive time verifying content forces them to trust the content if it aligns with their political motives and ideals. The SPN also relies on dozens of fauxperts and homegrown research to promote and support endless amounts of false claims. One of the most effective methods for designing and circulating disinformation is adopting the conventions for professional and academic genres and finding fauxperts to generate and support misleading statements that condition audiences to trust the SPN. Disinformation networks also acquire significant power from layering disinformation tactics together and linking them across platforms. Each layer of disinformation impedes transparency. The labor and time required to pull apart and analyze numerous layers of disinformation is overwhelming and disorienting. Furthermore, I contend that networked platforms that design disinformation are disinplatforms. Learning how to identify a disinformation network and how this network designs and circulates disinformation across multiple platforms is an important digital literacy needed to promote and, perhaps, save democracy in the age of disinformation. To learn more about the background for this project, examine the exigence. </p>
