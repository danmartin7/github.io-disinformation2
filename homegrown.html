              <p class="description"></p> 

              <p>The SPN uses what I term homegrown research to manufacture credibility in its digital publications and source materials. Homegrown evidence is the source material, research, and data the SPN produces to design disinformation. It is interjected and woven in to the structures and forms of a variety of professional genres. The SPN produces and publishes its own research and data across its websites to support its arguments and shift mainstream media narratives on numerous topics. In a special journal issue from the Combating Terrorist Center at West Point, Amarasingam and Argentino (2020) examine how disinformation networks like QAnon are “Imitating source citation and evidence presentation in academic scholarship" to appear credible, distort the truth, and confuse readers. They contend that “QAnon followers regularly engage in elaborate presentations of evidence to substantiate their claims. In this vein, they often self-identify as investigative journalists or conspiracy researchers” when they have no expertise in those areas and the research is fabricated (Amarasingam & Argentino, 2020). The SPN, like other disinformation networks, conducts studies, generates empirical research, and designs surveys, interviews, and observations to feed its disinformation network. SPN affiliates publish documents about fake studies and mimic professional and academic genres, employing the standards and conventions for peer-reviewed research without a transparent disclosure of how a study was conducted and verified. It is crucial that audiences learn how to recognize fake research in digital writing environments. This section of the webtext provides examples of homegrown evidence and methods to identify it. Again, many of the links to the examples of homegrown evidence I cited in early drafts of this webtext have since been removed or deleted. All the links to the examples worked before publishing this webtext, so any links to SPN webpages that have a 404 error after the publication of this webtext are further evidence of how unstable disinformation networks because they are constantly deleting material.</p>
              <p>Academic and professional genres help the SPN disguise homegrown evidence and manufacture an illusion of credibility that amplifies the SPN's core messages, arguments, and home-made data. Learning how to identify homegrown research is an important digital literacy in the era of disinformation. Knowing how disinformation networks design and circulate homegrown research is a form of crap detection. In this first example, to keep audiences from questioning its source references, the Alaska Policy Forum (APF), an <a href="spnwebsites.html"><u>SPN affiliate</u></a>, uses homegrown evidence as a layer of disinformation. In a report published on the “Alaska Policy Forum” (APF) website, the author references and quotes homegrown research from another SPN affiliate, The Buckeye Institute. There is a link to the report below:</p>
              <p>
                <center>
                  <a href="https://alaskapolicyforum.org/2019/04/unsustainable-spending-the-state-of-alaskas-budget-and-economy/" target="_blank">
                    <img src="assets/img/spn/alaskapolicyreport.png" alt="An screenshot of webpage for the Alaska Policy Forum that allows users to download an economic report." width="700" height="300" class="center">
                  </a>
              </p>
              <p>Figure 1: Alaska Policy Forum Policy Report. 6-5-2020. </center>
              </p>
              <p>The APF "is proud to have partnered with economic experts at the Buckeye Institute" (Marcum, 2019), both of which are part of the SPN. Without knowledge of the connection between these organizations, audiences may assume the references are from a reputable, third-party publication outlet outside of the APF. Marcum refers to The Buckeye Institute (BI) as an economic research center that employs experts, but the <a href="https://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/" target="_blank"><u>BI</u></a> is an SPN affiliate that generates questionable and misleading research like the other affiliates. Homegrown evidence helps construct a system of credibility that does not adhere to established verification methods, tools, and processes. Audiences need to know how organizations use digital writing environments to disguise homegrown evidence. Learning how the SPN's web publications are connected to the SPN is a form of crap detection. The APF and the BI reviewed the Alaska State Budget and wrote a 49-page policy report with detailed suggestions for how Alaska should tax its citizens. The research and evidence to support the proposal were homegrown, created by the SPN for the SPN. The APF asserted that it paid the BI to conduct a research report, but the BI is part of the same network, serving the same interests and pushing the same <a href="narrative.html"><u>narrative</u></a>. The BI is also appropriating credibility from its name and association with a major research university, the Ohio State University, also known as the Buckeyes. Appropriating the name of a research university limits users from questioning or recognizing the vast amount of homegrown research riddled throughout both of these websites. </p>
              <p>The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL) cites homegrown evidence from a survey it created and deliberately withholds details about the survey needed to interpret the results. Below is an image of the survey because the webpage has since been removed:</p>
              <p>
                <center>
                  <img src="assets/img/spn/willfauxdata.png" alt="This screenshot is of written text. I took this image because the SPN deletes webpages rapdily." width="600" height="400" class="center">
                  </a>
              </p>
              <p>Figure 2: WILL Website. Homegrown Survey. 6-19-2020. </center>
              </p>
              <p> WILL never discloses the percentage of republicans, democrats, and independents who responded to the survey. We also don't know how many total republicans were surveyed, so we unsure of how many republicans account for 55% of the total survey takers. An online global marketing firm, Dynata, surveyed 556 people for the WILL survey, but we never learn how the sample was collected, where and when it was collected, and how it leads to a margin error of 4%. Were the respondents mostly male? Female? Without this information, audiences cannot interpret the survey results accurately. Reading digital content critically requires learning how to identify problematic primary research like surveys and interviews used to generate homegrown evidence. Because digital disinformation networks conduct their own primary research to create evidence for false and misleading claims audiences need to know how to verify primary research results and put on a monocle to critique digital sources and hold creators of digital information accountable. </p>

              <p>Figure 3: WILL Problematic Data Chart. 6-20-2020. </center>
              </p>
              <p>Since we do not know how many survey respondents came from each party, it's difficult to interpret the survey results. For starters, there is a 135.52% respondent total. How does that statistic work in this context? WILL asserts that it ran “difference-of-means t-tests” to identify how other messages shaped the survey responses, but asking a series of rhetorical questions quickly exposes deeper issues with this study. What other messages is WILL referring to? Where are those messages, and what type of information will the t-tests provide us? The explanations for the value of the tests are also vague and misleading. The use and presence of a testing apparatus and its subsequent equations forms an illusion of verifiable research similar to a <a href="datadump.html"><u>data dump</u></a>, but the results of these tests fail to provide any valuable or usable findings. There are no clear explanations for why this test matters and how it produces important results. The presence of a statistical testing tool without any context or explanation of its relevancy is a disinformation tactic designed to create ethos where there is none. WILL is deliberately confusing users and limiting their ability to locate and verify sources and interpret data. Becoming aware of the tactics disinformation networks use to confuse audiences is an important critical digital literacy. </p>

              </p>
              <p>WILL also supplied survey respondents with the following unverified claims to consider before taking the survey, and it asked them how each claim would alter their understanding and opinion for reopening the economy during Covid in 2020. It is implied that the four messages are supported with evidence, but there is no evidence for these claims. The messages in the survey are provided below:</p>
              <p>
                <center>
                  <img src="assets/img/spn/willfauxdata4.png" alt="This image contains readable text. I use the screenshot because the link to the webpage was removed during the creation of this project." width="600" height="500" class="center">
              </p>
              <p>Figure 5: WILL. Disinformation Survey. 6-20-2020. </center>
              </p>
              <p>The first message references “some economists” but does not provide names or sources. The rest of the messages follow the same pattern. “Some scholars,” “Some research,” and “Some experts” are mentioned, but no names are provided or research referenced. What experts claim that “despair” will lead to more deaths than there have been from Covid thus far? This is an example of homegrown disinformation that is disguised as evidence from an objective survey. Audiences are likely to accept these arguments if they are unaware of how WILL manufactures and references its own data. Citing evidence from a networked affiliate without making that relationship transparent is a tactic for disguising misleading information. </p>
              <p>The Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy (JBCPP) publishes numerous articles on its website that refer to studies conducted by other SPN affiliate groups. The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a SPN affiliate, conducted a study for a JBCPP report titled, “<a href="https://jbartlett.org/2020/02/study-estimates-n-h-cost-of-green-new-deal-at-more-than-74000-per-household-in-first-year/" target="_blank"><u>Study</u></a> estimates N.H. cost of Green New Deal at more than $74,000 per household in first year.” Unless users are aware of the connection between the JBCPP and CEI, they might not be able to identify this report as homegrown research. Most audiences have no idea that the JBCPP and the CEI are connected through the SPN and that they share one goal. Moreover, the article from the <a href="https://jbartlett.org/category/energy/" target="_blank"><u>JBCPP</u></a> website quotes Matthew Gagnon, the CEO of the Maine Policy Institute, in addition to David Flemming from the Ethan Allen Institute and Andy Fowler, a communications specialist, from the Yankee Institute, all of which are SPN affiliate members. In the “Great Lakes Natural Fluctuation,” the Badger Institute quotes SPN <a href="fauxperts.html"><u>fauxpert</u></a>, Jason Hayes, the environmental director at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. </p>
              <p>

              <p>Figure 6: Badger Institute. <a href="https://www.badgerinstitute.org/BI-Files/Images/2020Spring_DIGGINGS.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Questionable Evidence</u></a> for Climate Science Denial. 6-19-2020. </center>
              </p>
              <p> The article falsely correlates the water level rise in the Great Lakes to a lack of global warming, and it argues that global warming doesn't exist because the water levels in the Great Lakes have always risen and dropped over time. However, the author of the article does not cite any evidence for these claims. There is a quote from Cornwall Alliance, but it is disconnected from the claim. Although the Cornwall Alliance is not part of the SPN, it is part of the Heritage Foundation, a Christain nationalist organization that denies global warming exists. We also have no idea who is conducting this research or who funded the research. What sources claim that wind and solar are inefficient? This article also cites a report from <i>Science Daily</i> (p. 9) but doesn't provide the title of the report. How would someone find this source? All of the source references in SPN publications are difficult to locate and verify or they come directly from the SPN. These are important questions to ask when examining digital sources. Websites afford the SPN an opportunity to publish and circulate homegrown sources without having to submit to a peer-review process before they are disseminated for public consumption. The Badger Institute takes advantage of an unmoderated digital writing environment and complicating users' ability to conduct adequate content verification. Creating and obfuscating homegrown sources are disinformation tactics, and audiences need to learn how to recognize them. </p>
              <p>On its website, the Georgia Center for Opportunity (GCO) argues that welfare, which it defines as social security and medicare, is “the leading driver of the ballooning U.S. national debt and annual budget deficits," and it references homegrown research to support these claims, but almost all the references in the article that I examined in 2020 are now gone. Furthermore, the current administration is launching unprecedented attacks on Medicare and Social Security using disinformation. Elon Musk has continually referred to Social Security as a ponzi scheme, and he has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/politics/elon-musk-social-security-conspiracy-theory-what-matters/index.html" target="_blank"><u>falsely</u></a> accused millions of people, both alive and deceased, of stealing from social security. This disinformation narrative about welfare debt is networked across disinplatforms as a deep story. Below is an example of how the GCO cites homegrown evidence in a report. </p>
              <p>
                <center>
                  <a href="https://foropportunity.org/" target="_blank">

              </p>
              <p>The link to the reports sends audiences to the GCO homepage so audiences will have to find the reports. Figure 9 is an example of the GCO's use of homegrown evidence in its branding campaign about problems with poverty. To produce one of the reports, the GCO hired The Heart and Mind Strategies, a branding and marketing firm, to design a study on poverty. The methodology for the study is confusing and difficult to interpret. The links to the report have been removed, too. A marketing firm conducting sociological research is troubling and concerning.</p>

              <p>Figure 8: GCO Website. Homegrown Evidence. 6-8-2020. </center>
              </p>
              <p> The GCO uses several different surveys to collect data for the study and each one has a different N value. There also are no explanations provided for these numbers and surveys. We don't know how poverty is defined for this study or what the demographics are for the parents and teens who took it. We also don't know why phase one occurs in Georgia and Utah or how phase two is nationally representative. How is phase two going to use data from two states to represent national consensus? What will phase one represent? What kind of data will these phases create and what will the data show? Audiences also need to know what the omnibus survey and the illumination lab are. Who took the omnibus survey and what happens during the 90 minutes in the illumination lab? There are far too many unanswered and highly problematic questions about this study to value its results. Learning how to ask these types of questions about digital writing is vital for marking disinformation. The SPN uses homegrown research like survey data to spin opinion into fact. Audiences need to learn how to recognize homegrown research in digital writing environments and how disinformation networks manufacture data and evidence to disguise homegrown research. In addition to homegrown evidence, SPN affiliates also provide users with large acontextual data sets without providing a summary or interpretation of the data. Audiences are left to make sense of the data on their own. <a href="datadump.html"><u>The Data Dump</u></a>. </p>
