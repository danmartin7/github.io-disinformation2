          <p>Overwhelming users with too much data is an effective disinformation tactic. The SPN publishes large sets of acontextual data on its websites and uses interactive visualization tools to give the illusion that the data is valid or useful. However, the accuracy of any data set is directly connected to one's ability to read the data correctly. Data dumps confuse audiences and, more importantly, they allow users an opportunity to confuse themselves. Audiences are left to their own accord to make sense of the data any way they choose. Alice Marwick and Rebecca Lewis (2017) highlight how disinformation is dependent on “The preservation of ambiguity” (p. 5) and that “Ambiguity is, itself, a strategy” (p. 11) that producers of misleading information rely on to design disinformation. Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) assert that a massive acontextual data set forces users “to imagine what he or she is thinking about or looking at” (p. 68) because they do not know how to read the data and form it into a cohesive message. Visual data “can become a source of representational manipulation” (Kress & van Leeuwen, p. 68) when it lacks contextualization. Placing large data sets on a website without providing a frame for users to analyze the data is a form of representational manipulation and a common disinformation tactic. Furthermore, spending time decoding acontextual data and information can inhibit the ability to make an important decision in a timely manner. Remember, many of the webpages I examined for this study have since been taken down. Several documents the SPN create or publish are not meant for archiving or to exist longer than they're needed. Data dumps are also symbols of quantitative evidence and authority, a representation of positivism and the existence of empirical evidence, even when the data has no value or is uninterpretable. The appearance of data is a symbol of truth for many audiences. The logic of numbers and statistics, no matter how inaccurate, move people's imagination toward surety and stability. Understanding how data sets confuse audiences is a form of crap detection. Contextualizing data so audiences can read it accurately is a trustworthy digital writing practice. </p>
          <p>Data visualizations require visual literacies for audiences to decode and interpret. Visually prepositioning, resizing, and reshaping data can further distort a user's ability to interpret the data. When examining data sets and visualizations, Tufte (1997) suggests assessing the ethical and moral value of an image or data visual, and that a complete and comprehensive “source of history" of the visualization "must be documented” for it to have value and authority (p. 25). Where did the image or data come from? What is its history? These are questions audiences need to ask every time they encounter data sets in digital writing environments. “Making verbs visible is at the heart of visual design,” so examining how visuals act and how they facilitate action is important for understanding what data is and does (Tufte, p. 55). Visualizing and locating verbs in data visuals are important digital literacies. Hiding the verbs, or failing to provide them in the first place, can be a deliberate distortion of a visual's meaning and lead to audiences using any verb they want to make meaning of the data. The Civitas's <a href="https://www.mappingtheleft.com/media-gallery/" target="_blank">"Mapping the Left Project"</a> uses visuals, charts, and graphs to keep track of the names of democratic voters. Civitas provides audiences with an interactive visualization for identifying the names of democratic voters, activists, and organizations in the state of North Carolina, but what does that mean to audiences? How does knowing a democrat's name have value? How is this useful information in this context? Even though the purpose of the data visualization is unclear, the presence of a data visualization continues to expand the illusion that the SPN is credible because it can be a symbol of knowledge without providing actual knowledge. </p>
          <p>The Tax Education Foundation ( <a href="https://spn.org/articles/spn-welcomes-tax-education-foundation/" target="_blank">TEF</a>) in Iowa had a link on its website (when I started this research project) to a 104-page data report about education savings accounts that would take an inordinate amount of time to read and interpret. I wasted several hours verifying these sources. This lengthy report, written by a visiting scholar, was never intended to be read. It is merely a representation of academic rigor, filled with jargon, numbers, equations, and graphs that very few people can interpret. Again, even when the data is unreadable, its presence can still symbolize a high standard of quality. Publications that contain unreadable data can represent rigor, and the more dense the data the less likely audiences will try to verify its content or question its authenticity. About 90 of the 104 pages in the TEF report are tables of figures and numbers about the estimated effects of a state bill on education reform that very few audiences will be able to analyze without a context and specific verbs. Enormous amounts of uncontextualized data overwhelm and exhaust audiences, forcing users to trust the data if they can't make sense of it. </p>
          <p>The Empire Center for Public Policy (ECPP) houses a large amount of raw, acontextual data on its website without providing audiences with a frame to interpret the data. Audiences are left on their own to decode the data, which makes them more likely to confuse themselves or to use the data to falsely correlate claims. The ECPP website contains dozens of confusing data sets that support misleading claims for a range of issues. Many of these data sets are without a context so audiences are positioned to misinform themselves and distort the meaning of the data.</p>

          <p>Tufte (1997) explains that when “scientific images become dequantified, the language of analysis may drift toward credulous descriptions of form, pattern, and configuration rather than answers to the questions: How many? How often? Where? How much?” (p. 23). The presence of specific forms, patterns, and configurations can become symbols and representations of credibility instead of the quality of the research methods and its results. If graphs and charts possess the right form, pattern, and configuration, they can become authoritative despite failing to provide accurate data. </p>

            <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Pioneer_Institute_for_Public_Policy_Research" target="_blank">The Pioneer Institute (PI)</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Mackinac_Center_for_Public_Policy" target="_blank">the Mackinac Center for Public Policy</a>, and the <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Pegasus_Institute" target="_blank">Pegasus Institute</a> rely on a similar tactic for publishing data. For example, the PI's quantitative data about Covid is extremely difficult to decode because it does not provide a background on how the data was generated and processed; however, the presence of this data correlates the PI with a respectable research organization. It is difficult to assess the ethicality and factuality of a data visual in digital writing spaces when the visual has been recontexualized many times or purposely decontextualized. Without an understanding of where data come from, without its history, audiences will struggle to analyze the data. Students can examine the Mackinac Center's webpage below and other SPN websites and practice locating problematic data and explaining how and why it's dishonest or problematic.

          <p>The <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Wyoming_Liberty_Group" target="_blank">Wyoming Liberty Group</a> (WLG) provides audiences with images of equations that no lay person would understand without the assistance of an expert. Most audiences cannot interpret an equation like the one provided below, so they will trust the given interpretation of the equation and if they trust the author and share the same value system as the SPN. The example below in figure 3 has been removed from the WLG website. </p>

          <p>Many people interpret the presence and complexity of equations as a marker of credibility and a representation of intellectual rigor and fact. Equating difficult and incomprehensible equations with expertise and assuming they have valuable meaning when they don't is a common disinformation tactic. Most people will agree with the WLG's interpretation of the equation to avoid drawing attention to their inability to comprehend or answer the equation. Math equations are symbols of power and intelligence in a culture obssessed with positivism and empiricism. Equations can acquire authority and power from their incomprehensiblity. The SPN targets audiences who are least likely to admit when they're confused and who lack the knowledge to solve equations like the one in figure 3 or identify the misapplication of equations to support specific claims. Identifying the misapplication of sources and data and recognizing how random equations are used for disinformation is a form of crap detection. Many of these fake equations and data are endorsed or created by <a href="fauxpert.html">fauxperts</a>. </p>
